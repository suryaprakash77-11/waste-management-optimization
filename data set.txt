🔧 Project Title: IoT-Waste Management Optimization System using ESP32 and Blynk

📍 1. Objective

The IoT-Waste Management Optimization System is designed to automate the segregation, monitoring, and notification process in a smart waste disposal environment. This system differentiates between wet and dry waste using a soil moisture sensor, evaluates bin fill levels using ultrasonic sensors, and notifies authorities through a cloud-based interface powered by the Blynk IoT platform. This dataset document explains all sensor data sources, data flow, transformations, thresholds, and the dataset's final structure for analytics and decision-making.

🧠 2. System Architecture Overview

✨ Key Functional Modules:

Trash Classification: Moisture sensor detects if the incoming waste is wet or dry.

Servo Automation: Servo motor opens and closes the gate for wet trash bin.

Bin Monitoring: Ultrasonic sensors monitor fill levels of dry and wet bins.

Cloud Notification: Alerts are sent using the Blynk platform when bins are full.

Data Logging: Sensor readings and states are logged for historical analysis.

✅ Main Goals:

Automate waste classification and sorting

Optimize garbage collection schedules

Prevent bin overflow

Enable real-time and historical monitoring via cloud

📊 4. Data Flow and Processing Logic

4.1 Moisture Sensor (Wet/Dry Classification)

Raw Value: Analog input (0–4095)

Calibration:

Calibrated Moisture (%) = (max_moisture - moisture_value) / ((max_moisture - min_moisture) / 100)

Threshold: If calibrated value > threshold, classify as Wet Waste, else Dry Waste

Action:

If Wet Waste: Open Servo (0°), wait 5 seconds, then close (90°)

4.2 Ultrasonic Sensors (Bin Fill Level)

Raw Value: Pulse duration (in microseconds)

Distance Calculation:

Distance = duration * 0.034 / 2 (in cm)

Threshold for Full Bin: If distance < 4 cm, bin is Full

Blynk Output:

Dry Bin: V0 = 1 (Full) or 0 (Not Full)

Wet Bin: V1 = 1 (Full) or 0 (Not Full)

🌐 5. Cloud Communication with Blynk

Platform: Blynk IoT

Auth Token: Used to authenticate device

Virtual Pins:

V0: Dry Bin Status (1 = Full, 0 = Not Full)

V1: Wet Bin Status (1 = Full, 0 = Not Full)
